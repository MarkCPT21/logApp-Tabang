# Installation
## Setting up on Local server
In order for us to work with any of the storable and retrievable data, we had to use the tools for SQL. Before making our web app works on a web server, we have to make it work locally first.

That is why we needed to use <i>Xampp Control Panel</i>. It enabled us to set up, develop, test, and deploy our web app project on our local server. The modules that we needed are the <i>Apache Server</i> and an <i>SQL</i> for data management.

<i>PhpMyAdmin Control Panel</i> on localhost let us manage databases easier and faster because of the advanced functions that are ready made to use in a website development.

## Setting up our Database Free Web Server
To be able for us to use a database online remotely, we needed to create an account at '<i>freesqldatabase.com</i>.' It is very handy for us because it provided us SQL database functionality for free. PhpMyAdmin control panel is also there which made us feel at home. The only thing that bothered us is how it loads slower than in our local computer's server but it is okay because it is free to use.
